<h3>Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one. For example, the sequence for n=3 is as follows:</br>
3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
<br/>
Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given value of n.

<h5>
<b>Input:</b><br>
The only input line contains an integer n.<br>
<b>Output:</b><br>
Print a line that contains all values of n during the algorithm.
Constraints
<br>
1 <= n <= 10^6
<br><br><b>Example:</b><br>
Input:<br>
3<br>
<br>
Output:<br>
3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1
